# Multi Linguistic Game of Nim

So, Game of Nim is a very basic game. I've not created anything new with regard to game.

Rather through this game I wish to introduce **Beginner Coders/Programmers** who are not
sure to choose language to start with or to make as a career or juct for an hobby or fun.
So, I created this Repository for anyone who wishes to get a sneak peek into languages.

## How it would help

Game of Nim will be written in as many languages as possible.
So that For every language, a starter may know basic things such as :

1. Tools - IDE, Compiler/Interpreter for Language.
2. Header/Library/Dependancies for Language Files.
3. Program Structure & Language Syntax.
4. Variable Decleration & Data Types.
5. Looping Structures.
6. Control Structures.
7. Functions.

In this way any starter could easily find how and which language to choose for the code one he/she wishes to write.

## Contribution

You can contribute to project in one of the ways mentioned below :

1. Find a language (in which you code) and write the Code.<br/><br/>
   * Refer to [About.md file](https://github.com/elMaverick/Single-Heap-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/about.md) for the logic of Game.<br/>
   Save your code as > nim-source.<language extension><br/>
   Create another file with name as nim-exp.<language extension> that will explain each<br/>
   line of code, what it does in the program with the proper syntax instructions.<br/>
   Say you created this program in ruby, then name of file would be **nim-source.rb** & explanation for the langauge will
   be saved as **nim-exp.rb**
   
2. If program for Game of Nim in your coding Language already exists,<br/>
   Either try to improve the code by giving suggesstions.<br/>
   OR write a documentation file for the language under name nim-exp.<language extension><br/>

Your Contribution will always be appreciated. Happy Coding.
