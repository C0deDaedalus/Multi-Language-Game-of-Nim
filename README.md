# Multi Linguistic Game of Nim

So, Game of Nim is a very basic game. I've not created anything new with regard to game.

Rather through this game I wish to introduce **Beginner Coders/Programmers** who are not
sure to choose language to start with or to make as a career or juct for an hobby or fun.
So, I created this Repository for anyone who wishes to get a sneak peek into languages.

## How it would help

Game of Nim will be written in as many languages as possible.
So that For every language, a starter may know basic things such as :

1. Tools - IDE, Compiler/Interpreter for Language.
2. Header/Library/Dependancies for Language Files.
3. Program Structure & Language Syntax.
4. Variable Decleration & Data Types.
5. Looping Structures.
6. Control Structures.
7. Functions.

In this way any starter could easily find how and which language to choose for the code
one he/she wishes to write.

## Contribution

You can contribute to project in one of the ways mentioned below :

1. Find a language (in which you code) and write the Code.
   Refer to [about.md file](https://github.com/elMaverick/Single-Heap-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/about.md) for the logic of Game.
   Save the file as > nim-source.<language extension>
   Say you created program in ruby, then name of file would be nim-source.rb
   Create another file with name as nim-exp.<language extension> that will explain each
   line of code, what it does in the program with the proper syntax instructions.
