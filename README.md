# Multi Linguistic Game of Nim

So, Game of Nim is a very basic game. I've not created anything new with regard to game.

Rather through this game I wish to introduce **Beginner Coders/Programmers** who are not
sure to choose what language to start with or to make a career in or just for hobby or fun.
So, I created this Repository for anyone who wishes to get a sneak peek into languages and
its basic syntax and logics.

## How it would help

Game of Nim will be written in as many languages as possible.
So that For any language, a begineer may know basic things such as :

1. Tools - IDE, Compiler/Interpreter for Language.
2. Header/Library/Dependancies for Language Files.
3. Program Structure & Language Syntax.
4. Variable Declaration, Data Types, Arithmetic & Operators.
5. Decision/Control Structures.
6. Looping Structures.
7. Functions.

Then we could easily find how & which language to choose for coding by comparing same Program
written under different Languages.

## Your Contribution

You can contribute to project in one of the ways mentioned below :

1. Find a language (in which you code) and write the Code.<br/><br/>
   Refer to [About.md file](https://github.com/elMaverick/Single-Heap-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/about.md) for the Rules of Game.<br/><br/>
   Write your code and Save it as **nim-source.language_extension**<br/>
   Create another file with name as **nim-exp.language_extension** that will explain each
   line of code, what it does in the program with the proper syntax instructions.
   * Say you created this program in ruby, then name of file would be **nim-source.rb**
                      & explanation for the langauge will be saved as **nim-exp.rb**
   
2. If program for Game of Nim in your coding Language already exists, then
   * Either try to improve the code by giving suggesstions.<br/>
   * OR write a **Documentation file** for the language under name **nim-exp.language_extension**<br/>

Your Contribution will always be appreciated. ***Happy Coding***
