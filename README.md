# Multi Language Game of Nim

So, Game of Nim is a very basic game. I've not created anything new with regard to game.

Rather through this game I wish to introduce **Beginner Coders/Programmers** who are not
sure to choose what language to start with or to make a career in or just for hobby or fun.
So, I created this Repository for anyone who wishes to get a sneak peek into languages and
its basic syntax and logics.

You can Say, It's a kind of Notes on a Programming Langauge for Beginners. 

## How it would help

Game of Nim will be written in as many languages as possible.
So that For any language, a beginner may know basic things such as :

1. Tools - IDE, Compiler/Interpreter for Language.
2. Header/Library/Dependancies for Language Files.
3. Program Structure & Language Syntax.
4. Variable Declaration, Data Types, Arithmetic & Operators.
5. Decision/Control Structures.
6. Looping Structures.
7. Functions.

Then one could easily find how & which language is suitable for him/her by comparing same Program
written under different Languages.

## Your [Contribution](https://github.com/C0deDaedalus/Multi-Language-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

You can contribute to project in one of the ways mentioned below :

1. Find a language (in which you code) and write the Code.<br/><br/>
   Refer to [About.md file](https://github.com/elMaverick/Single-Heap-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/about.md) for the Rules of Game.<br/><br/>
   Write your code and Save it as **nim-source.language_extension**<br/>
   Make Sure the source file contains no comments at all except
   1. Program Title : Game of Nim - (matchsticks/marbles/stones/chocolates/whatever you like)
   2. Author(your full name) with date & time, code written on<br/>

   Create another file with name as **nim-exp.language_extension** that will explain each
   line of code, what it does in the program with the proper syntax instructions. This is the file where you have to put comments as much as you can.
   
   Say you created this program in ruby, then name of file would be **nim-source.rb**
                    & explanation for the langauge will be saved as **nim-exp.rb**
   
2. If program for Game of Nim in your coding Language already exists, then
   * Either try to improve the code by giving suggesstions.<br/>
   * OR write a **Documentation file** for the language under name **nim-exp.language_extension**<br/>

Your Contribution will always be appreciated. ***Happy Coding***
