# Multi Language Game of Nim


## Introduction
So, Game of Nim is a very basic game. I've not created anything new with regard to game.

Rather through this game I wish to introduce **Beginner Coders/Programmers** who are not
sure to choose what language to start with or to make a career in or just for hobby or fun.
So, I created this Repository for anyone who wishes to get a sneak peek into languages and
its basic syntax and logics.

You can Say, It's a kind of Notes on a Programming Langauge for Beginners. 

## How it would help

`Game of Nim will be written in as many languages as possible`.
So that For any language, a beginner may know basic things such as :

1. Tools - IDE, Compiler/Interpreter for Language.
2. Header/Library/Dependancies for Language Files.
3. Program Structure & Language Syntax.
4. Variable Declaration, Data Types, Arithmetic & Operators.
5. Decision/Control Structures.
6. Looping Structures.
7. Functions.

Then one could easily find how & which language is suitable for him/her by comparing same Program
written under different Languages.

## Before You Contribute
Please note that this repository is meant to be a clean place for codestore that will help Begineers to understand the Simplicities & Complexities of languages. Please, Do not put/do anything messy or ambigous here. As a safe practice another [dummy repository](https://github.com/C0deDaedalus/DummyRepo "Dummy Repository") is being created. Fork that, add some changes to that, create a pull request, merge & save. That's kind of practice repository for you to do messy things in case you don't know how-to. All this is done in order to maintain this repository to be full of clean code pushes. I hope everyone agrees with that.
