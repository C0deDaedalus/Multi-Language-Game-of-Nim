# Game of Nim
  Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects (Matchsticks in our case) from
  distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided
  they all come from the same heap. <b>The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who must remove the last object.</b>
