## Your Contribution

You can contribute to project in one of the ways mentioned below :

1. Find a language (in which you code) and write the Code.<br/><br/>
   Refer to [About.md file](https://github.com/elMaverick/Single-Heap-Game-of-Nim/blob/master/about.md) for the Rules of Game.<br/><br/>
   Write your code and Save it as **nim_source.language_extension**<br/>.
   Make Sure the source file contains no comments at all except
   1. Program Title : Game of Nim - (matchsticks/marbles/stones/chocolates/whatever you like)
   2. Author(your full name) with date & time, code written on<br/>

   Create another file with name as **nim_exp.language_extension** that will explain each
   line of code, what it does in the program with the proper syntax instructions. This is the file where you have to put comments as much as you can.
   
   Say you created this program in ruby, then name of file would be **nim_source.rb**
                    & explanation for the langauge will be saved as **nim_exp.rb**
   
2. If program for Game of Nim in your coding Language already exists, then
   * Either try to improve the code by giving suggesstions.<br/>
   * OR write a **Documentation file** for the language under name **nim_exp.language_extension**<br/>

Your Contribution will always be appreciated. ***Happy Coding***
